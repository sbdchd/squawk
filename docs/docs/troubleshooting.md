## common error messages

### postgres failed to parse query

Squawk was unable to parse the query using the PostgreSQL parser.

Usually the provided statement contains an error and isn't a validÂ Postgres statement.

Squawk uses the [libpg_query-sys](https://github.com/tdbgamer/libpg_query-sys) Rust bindings to [libpg_query](https://github.com/pganalyze/libpg_query) to parse Postgres queries using the Postgres parser.
