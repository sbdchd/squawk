Using `character` is likely a mistake and should almost always be replaced by `text` or `varchar`.

From the postgres docs:

> There is no performance difference among these three types, apart from
> increased storage space when using the blank-padded type, and a few extra CPU
> cycles to check the length when storing into a length-constrained column.
> While character(n) has performance advantages in some other database systems,
> there is no such advantage in PostgreSQL; in fact character(n) is usually the
> slowest of the three because of its additional storage costs. In most
> situations text or character varying should be used instead.

See the [`prefer-text-field`](./prefer-text-field.md) rule for info on the advantages of `text` over `varchar`.

Instead of:

```sql
CREATE TABLE "app_user" (
    "id" serial NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    "name" char(100) NOT NULL,
    "email" character NOT NULL,
);
```

Use:

```sql
CREATE TABLE "app_user" (
    "id" serial NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    "name" varchar(100) NOT NULL,
    "email" TEXT NOT NULL,
);
```
