warning[ban-truncate-cascade]: Using `CASCADE` will recursively truncate any tables that foreign key to the referenced tables! So if you had foreign keys setup as `a <- b <- c` and truncated `a`, then `b` & `c` would also be truncated!

  ╰ help: Remove the `CASCADE` and specify exactly which tables you want to truncate.
